Q: Why is the nomination open only for the period 10-25 years, wasn't it all years in the past?
A: When the award was created, it was part of the 25th anniversary of the conference.  It was always intended to consider papers for 10-25 years. In the first few years nominations from older papers were considered, but going forward it will be a sliding window of 10-25 years ago.
