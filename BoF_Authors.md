**Q. What is a BoF?**

A. BoFs are non-commercial and focus on community building through interactive presentations and discussions covering a wide variety of topics. Successful BoF submissions will often involve any combination of presentations, audience discussion, roadmap discussions, question and answer periods, and community meetups.
 
**Q. What isn’t a BoF?**

A. There are a few things for which BoFs are not the appropriate venue:

* Vendors advertising their latest product release or feature (for this, consider the [Exhibitor Forum](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/exhibits/exhibitor-forum/));
* A session consisting solely or mainly of presentations or discussion between a small group of experts (for this, submit a proposal for a Panel);
* A project team meeting that is not focused on building community (e.g., by not allowing non-project team members in the discussion).
 
**Q. How should a BoF be organized?**

A. While we do not prescribe how a BoF should be organized, BoFs should have a format that ensures high levels of audience interaction. Talks and presentations should be oriented in a way to provoke community discussion, rather than as purely informational. An example of a useful presentation in this sense is a roadmap update to open feedback on how to orient future efforts in an open source software project.
 
**Q. When are BoFs held?**

A. BoFs are generally held in parallel tracks at approximately the following times:
* Tuesday, November 19, Noon–1:30 pm and 5–6:30 pm
* Wednesday, November 20, Noon–1:30 pm and 5–6:30 pm
* Thursday, November 21, Noon–1:30 pm
 
**Q. Can my BoF be scheduled outside of these times?**

A. We will try to accommodate scheduling constraints as best we can, but we will not be able to accommodate all requests. It is best to make any potential scheduling conflicts known to us as early as possible.
 
**Q. Can I request special equipment for my BoF?**

A. In general, no. BoF rooms will be equipped with standard A/V equipment such as projectors and microphones, including portable microphones for brief presentations and audience participation. We do not anticipate being able to accommodate any requests for additional equipment or reconfiguration of the provided equipment and furniture.
 
**Q. Who can attend BoFs?**

A. All badges valid Tuesday–Thursday grant BoF access; Workshops-only and Tutorials-only registrants do not get access.
 
**Q. Do BoF speakers, moderators, or organizers receive an honorarium?**

A. No.
 
**Q. Do BoF speakers, moderators, or organizers receive any registration waivers or discounts?**

A. No.
