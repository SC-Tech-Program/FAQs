Preparing Your Submission
----------------

**Q: Where can I submit my workshop proposal?**

A: Workshop proposals are submitted via the [SC19 submissions website](https://submissions.supercomputing.org/).

**Q: What is the format of a workshop proposal?**

A: The Workshops submission form gathers information about the history, format, content, and needs of the proposed workshop, along with an attached document summarizing the workshop’s scope, relevance, participants, etc. A sample submission form is available on the [SC19 submissions website](https://submissions.supercomputing.org/).

**Q: Is there a limit to the number of workshop organizers?**

A: Yes, please limit workshop organizers to four for simplicity of communication. You are welcome to include more participants on your scientific or steering committees.

Review Criteria
----------------

**Q: Is my workshop peer-reviewed?**

A: Yes. Workshop proposals are reviewed by a committee of experts. Each proposal will have at least three reviewers.

**Q: Is the peer-review process double-blind?**

A: No. Reviewers have access to the names of Workshops submitters. While Workshops Committee members are named on the [SC19 Planning Committee](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/planning-committee/) page, the names of the individuals reviewing each proposal are not made available to the authors.

Conflict of Interest
----------------

**Q: What are the guidelines for Conflicts of Interest (COI)?**

A: A potential conflict of interest occurs when a person is involved in making a decision that:

1. Could result in that person, a close associate of that person, or that person’s company or institution receiving significant financial gain, such as a contract or grant.
2. Could result in that person, or a close associate of that person, receiving significant professional recognition, such as an award or the selection of a paper, work, exhibit, or other type of submitted presentation.

Authors and Workshops Committee members will be given the opportunity to list any potential COIs during the submissions and review processes, respectively. The Workshops Committee Chair will make every effort to avoid assignments that have a potential COI.

According to the SC Conference you have a conflict of interest with:

* Your PhD advisors, post-doctoral advisors, PhD students, and post-doctoral advisees forever;
* Family relations by blood or marriage, or equivalent (e.g., a partner);
* People with whom you collaborated in the past five years. Collaborators include: co-authors on an accepted/rejected/pending research paper; co-PIs on an accepted/pending grant; those who fund your research; researchers whom you fund; or researchers with whom you are actively collaborating;
* Close personal friends or others with whom you believe a conflict of interest exists;
* People who were employed by, or a student at, your primary institution(s) in the past five years, or people who are active candidates for employment at your primary institution(s).

Note that “service” collaborations, such as writing a DOE, NSF, or DARPA report, or serving on a program committee, or serving on the editorial board of a journal do not inherently create a COI.

**Q: Are workshop papers included in the SC Conference Proceedings?**

A: No, proceedings publication is up to workshop organizers.

**Q: Will my workshop be archived on the SC19 website?**
